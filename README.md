# first-person-aim-and-shoot
How do you aim and shoot, if your game is using a first person controller.  I'll explain making a simple first person controller with a game object and a camera. You will learn how to add a crosshair. And, you will learn how to fire a cannonball in the direction of the crosshair.  (and you will have fun doing so! haha :)
